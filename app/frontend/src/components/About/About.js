            <p>
              More than <strong>65% of the African population</strong> are
              smallholder farmers..
              <br />
              ..and about <strong>23% of sub-Saharan Africaâ€™s GDP</strong> comes
              from agriculture.
              <br />
              These figures are substantial; (about{" "}
              <b>
                <u>2 thirds the population</u>
              </b>{" "}
              and a{" "}
              <b>
                <u>quarter of the GDP</u>
              </b>
              ).
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>
                This basically means that more resources need to be deployed to
                support the farmer in every way possible.
              </strong>
              <br />
              <br />
              A significant number of these farmers still fetch low pay for
              their produce due to a lack of direct access to their target
              market. <br />
              They often resort to selling their farm produce to middlemen for
              awfully unfair, throwaway prices.
              <br />
              <br />
              These commodities then bounce off one broker to the next. This
              lengthens the supply-chain thereby appending an extra cost at each
              hop.
              <br />
              The end-user (consumer) eventually has no choice but to dig deeper
              into their pockets in order to afford the farm produce by the time
              it reaches them.
